<p><a href="https://ritchietorres.house.gov/">Rep. Ritchie Torres</a> is a Democrat representing New York's 15th congressional district. He is running for re-elction, which will take place on November 5th 2024. Here are some key issues important to Torres.</p>

<h2>Housing</h2>
<p>Housing is a key issue for Rep. Torres. He grew up in public housing and knows first-hand the improvements that are needed for NYCHA's conditions. He believes in expanding Section 8, building more addordable public housing, and improving the living conditions in NYCHA. 
</p>
<h2>LGBTQ Rights</h2>
<p>As an openly gay man, Torres has long been a supporter of LGBTQ rights. He wants to pass the Equality Act, which expand protections for LGBTQ people, as well as reverse anti-LGBTQ laws that were enacted during the Trump presidency. Torres also believes in expanding mental health options for the LGBTQ community.</p>
<h2>Economic Opportunity</h2>
<p>Part of Torres' platform is bringing more economic opportunity and improving quality of life in the Bronx. He believes the U.S. government could be doing more to combat poverty. He wants to expand the child tax credit, desegregate schools, and cancel student loan debt. 
</p>
<h2>Puerto Rican Statehood</h2>
<p>Torres, who is of Puerto Rican descent, supports Puerto Rico becoming a U.S. State. He supports the repeal of PROMESA, which he says <a href="https://torres.nyc/issues/puerto-rico">"represents an unprecedented assault on the self-governance of Puerto Rico."</a>. Torres believes that Puerto Ricans should be given seats in the Senate and House of Representatives, as well as the right to vote for U.S. President.</p>
